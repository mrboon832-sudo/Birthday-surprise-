        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-1">The following is a short story about the man you know today😊!</div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-2">
            <p>"I used to feel small. Weighed down by shame, bad habits, and a quiet lack of confidence. 
                Even my smile felt uncertain...."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-3">
            <p>"Then things started to shift. 
                I moved, I did extra classes, I pushed myself in ways I hadn't before. 
                Little wins began to add up."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-4">
            <p>"University brought its challenges, but also new friends and nights that turned into the best conversations I've ever had. 
                Old friendships reminded me what real loyalty looks like."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-5">
            <p>"Halfway through all of that, I did something silly — I tried Tinder, partly as a joke, partly curious. 
                I didn't expect much. Instead, I found myself opening up in small ways I hadn't in years. 
                That's where things began to feel different."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-6">
            <p>"When you came around, everything shifted — suddenly I had this new stamina, new speed, new strength out of nowhere. 
                Confidence I didn't even know was in me started rising up like it had been waiting for the right moment."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-7">
            <p>"Life felt lighter, like the world wasn't pressing down as hard anymore. 
                Even just talking to people became easier, as if your presence unlocked something I didn't realize was locked."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-8">
            <p>"Piece by piece I shed old weights. 
                I learned to stand taller, to laugh harder, and to quietly own the things I can be proud of. 
                Confidence came back — softer, steadier, without ego"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-9">
            <p>"You always teased me for being younger, and I'd laugh, because what's fresher than the youngest fruit? They say in China, “The newest bamboo shoot is the most tender.” 
                Maybe that's ME! — the youngest, but also the sharpest, strongest, and just right for you in the moment you needed me."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-10">
            <p>"You weren't the whole story. But you were the catalyst ✨ 
                — the spark that made things happen a little faster, a little brighter"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-11">
            <p class="korean">"너랑 있으면 기분이 좋아져."</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-12">
            <p>"…you're like a firefly — small, glowing, and utterly amazing"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-13">
            <p>"They say the best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, and the second best time is right now. 
                So here I am, right now, ready to start planting something real with you — something strong, something woody, something that grows. 
                Fear be damned, I'm twenty now, and I want that with you."</p>
