            <p>The following is a short story about the man you know today😊!</div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-2">
            <p>"I used to feel small. Weighed down by shame, bad habits, and a quiet lack of confidence. 
                Even my smile felt uncertain...."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-3">
            <p>"Then things started to shift. 
                I moved, I did extra classes, I pushed myself in ways I hadn't before. 
                Little wins began to add up."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-4">
            <p>"University brought its challenges, but also new friends and nights that turned into the best conversations I've ever had. 
                Old friendships reminded me what real loyalty looks like."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-5">
            <p>"Halfway through all of that, I did something silly — I tried Tinder, partly as a joke, partly curious. 
                I didn't expect much. Instead, I found myself opening up in small ways I hadn't in years. 
                That's where things began to feel different. That story ended and i learned all the lessons i had to from it. Now lets talk about 
                how far one joke can take you"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-6">
            <p>"The coffee was not a concrete plan i wasn't predicting anything and that was thrilling! When you came around, everything shifted — suddenly I had this new stamina, new speed, new strength out of nowhere. 
                Confidence I didn't even know was in me started rising up like it had been waiting for the right moment. She actually said yes and It felt like a sign and God was speaking to me to us.
                I usually listen to God when he says not to do something, but with you its just sign after sign to say yes!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-7">
            <p>"Life felt lighter, like the world wasn't pressing down as hard anymore. Because i am embracing a lot more things in life.
                Prayer, gratitude and hardwork that may not give much beyond experience!
                Even just talking to people became easier, as if your presence unlocked something I didn't realize was locked."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-8">
            <p>"Piece by piece I shed old weights. 
                I learned to stand taller, to laugh harder, and to quietly own the things I can be proud of. 
                Confidence came back — softer, steadier, without ego"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-9">
            <p>"I know I am a month younger, but what's fresher than the youngest fruit? They say in China, “The newest bamboo shoot is the most tender.” 
                Maybe that's ME! — the youngest, but also the sharpest, strongest, and just right for you in the moment you needed me."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-10">
            <p>"You weren't the whole story. But you were the catalyst ✨ 
                — the spark that made things happen a little faster, a little brighter.
                I imagine that if you dont want to be better when you are with someone then you are with the wrong person. If you are always right then i was your right choice!😊"</p>

            <p>"…You're like a songbird — a being blessed with a voice, one that makes people look up to the sky to thank God.You are utterly amazing"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="message-screen" id="screen-13">
            <p>"They say the best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, and the second best time is right now. 
                So here I am, right now, ready to start planting something real with you — something strong, something woody, something that grows. 
                Fear be damned, I'm twenty now, and I want that with you."</p>
